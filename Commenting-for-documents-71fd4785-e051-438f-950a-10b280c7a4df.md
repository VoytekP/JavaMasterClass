# Overview

What is the project? Why are we working on this? 

### Problem Statement

- Currently, users are unable to leave inline comments in a document.
- Many users have been hacking this by leaving comments inline in the document, but this detracts from the reading experience and is messy for everyone.

### Proposed Solution

- Implement comments for all documents.

# Success Criteria

1-3 sentences on what success for the project looks like. Include metrics and qualitative descriptors, if relevant. 

- 40% of weekly active users use comments within 2 weeks of shipping the feature.

# User Stories

What will the user be able to do after the solution is shipped? Include designs here, if any. 

- User can select text in a document and comment on it with rich text features.
- User can select a block in a document and comment on it.
- User can edit and delete a comment they have posted.
- User with read access can view comments created by anyone else with write or read access.
